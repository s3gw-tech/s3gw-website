## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup of a single-node K3s Kubernetes cluster with Rancher, together with the S3 Gateway (s3gw) and a Longhorn PV (Persistent Volume). This guide will use Digital Ocean, but these instructions will likely work with other cloud providers as well. 

<!--truncate-->

## Background

Before you begin, if you have not heard yet of the [s3gw](https://s3gw.io/) project, read this article first. The s3gw is a lightweight S3 service for Kubernetes users running on top of a Longhorn PV (and it comes with a nice user interface).

For the purpose of this article, there is assumed knowledge of [K3s](http://k3s.io/), [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) and [Longhorn](http://longhorn.io/).  However, if you need more information, you will find plenty of useful information in this blog.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have created a Droplet in Digital Ocean. For this specific tutorial, you will need the following: 

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64 
- CPU Options: Regular Intel with SSD + 8 GB / 4 CPUs  
- Add block storage: Leave as it is 
- Datacenter region: Choose the datacenter region closer to you 
- VPC Network: Leave as it is 
- Authentication: via SSH, click the "new SSH Key", follow the instructions given (identify your ssh key properly) and after it is added, select it with the appropriate checkbox. 
- Additional Options: Leave as it is 
- Finalize and create: identify your droplet with a hostname (ex: `<your name>-local-rancher`).
- Hit Create Droplet 

And there you go! You have a system ready to hack on!

## Prepare your system 

Now we need to set up your droplet. Install Helm:

```bash
$ ssh root@IP-ADDRESS
$ apt-get install open-iscsi
$ snap install --classic helm
```

1\. Install K3s 

Now, set up K3s: 

```bash
$ curl -sfL [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io/) | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.24.7+k3s1" sh -s - server --cluster-init 
$ export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml  
```

2\. Define a Kubernetes namespace 

Now, we need to define a Kubernetes namespace where the resources created by the chart should be installed: 

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace cattle-system 
```

3\. Set up certificate management 

Next, set up cert-manager: 

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f <https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml> 

$ helm repo add jetstack [https://charts.jetstack.io](https://charts.jetstack.io/)
$ helm repo update
$ helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager\
  --namespace cert-manager\
  --create-namespace\
  --version v1.7.1 
```

4\. Install Rancher server 

Once you are done installing K3s, install Rancher through the helm chart: 

```bash
$ helm repo add rancher-latest <https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest> 

$ helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher\
  --namespace cattle-system\
  --set hostname= IP-ADDRESS[.sslip.io](http://164.92.168.210.sslip.io/)\
  --set replicas=1\
  --set bootstrapPassword=PASSWORD 
```

We are using sslip.io as the DNS service. The installation will take some time. Then you will be ready to access Rancher:

5\. Retrieve the password 

Retrieve your password by running the following command: 

```bash
$ kubectl get secret --namespace cattle-system bootstrap-secret -o go-template='{{ .data.bootstrapPassword|base64decode}}{{ "\n" }}'
```

## Install s3gw using the Rancher UI

The s3gw can be found in the Rancher UI as a partner chart: 

To access, go to "Apps" and then "Charts". Choose the partner charts drop-down and click on the s3gw partner chart: 

![Rancher partner charts](https://www.suse.com/c/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/s3gw-partner-chart-1-1024x740.png)

Click  "Install" and tick the "Customize Helm options before install": 

![s3gw-install](https://www.suse.com/c/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/s3gw-install-1024x740.png)

Here are the remaining three steps: 

1. Set App Metadata: Select the project to install s3gw into. 
2. Values: Here, you can set up access and secret keys, storage, etc. The chart sets up a Longhorn volume by default.  Update are the hostnames for the S3 service and the UI:

3\. Finally, there are other options you can also set up additional deployment options:

![Helm options](https://www.suse.com/c/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/s3gw-helm-opts-1024x653.png)

And that's it! You can now access the s3gw UI in https://s3gw-ui.your.ip.here.sslip.io) :

![s3gw login](https://www.suse.com/c/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/s3gw-login-1024x747.png)

⚠️ "Network failure" issue.

When you try to log into the UI for the first time, you will find a "Network Failure" error. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/s3gw/issues/275). 

To work around this issue, access the S3 service URL first ([https://s3gw.your.ip.here.sslip.io](https://s3gw.your.ip.here.sslip.io/)). You will then be able to log into the UI:
