Some of it, especially screenshots, may contain\\n`aquarist-labs` references. Keep that in mind when following tutorials.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThose objects are then downloaded and staged by the internal engine\'s pipeline and, finally, they are deployed into the Kubernetes cluster as consumable applications.\\n\\nEpinio makes use of S3 as an internal private service. In this scenario, S3 can be thought of as an internal ephemeral cache with the purpose of storing temporary objects. For these needs, advanced redundancy measures are not necessary.\xa0Should the S3 backend experience a failure of any kind, software, or hardware; there would be no data loss, since Epinio has the ability to reconstruct the data of a project at any time.\\n\\nPrior to 1.7.0, Epinio could use only\xa0[Minio](https://min.io/)\xa0as S3 service. Starting from that version, we have since enabled the chart to also use the S3 Gateway (s3gw) project.\\n\\n[s3gw](https://s3gw.tech/)\xa0is a lightweight s3-compatible service that can be backed by any PVC within a Kubernetes environment, with a preference for\xa0[Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/)\xa0as the backing service. As said before, since we do not need an advanced redundancy strategy with Epinio, we can safely rely on a PVC provided by the default storage class deployed on the cluster.\\n\\nIf you are installing Epinio through the Rancher UI, enable the\xa0*Customize Helm options before install*\xa0checkbox:\\n\\n![Screenshot 1](/blog-assets/2023-03-01/epinio_s3gw_1-1024x732.png)\\n\\nIn the next page, click on the\xa0*S3 storage*\xa0section and disable the\xa0*Install Minio\xa0*checkbox*.*\\n\\nYou can now enable the\xa0*Install s3gw*\xa0checkbox.\\n\\n![Screenshot 1](/blog-assets/2023-03-01/epinio_s3gw_2-1024x732.png)\\n\\nThis is the simplest way to make Epinio work with s3gw.\\n\\nFor a more advanced customization, you can edit the Epinio chart\'s values.yaml file:\\n\\n```bash\\ns3gw:\xa0\\n\\n\xa0 enabled: false\xa0\\n\\n\xa0 ingress:\xa0\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 enabled: false\xa0\\n\\n\xa0 serviceName: s3gw\xa0\\n\\n\xa0 storageClass:\xa0\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 create: false\xa0\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 name: \'\'\xa0\\n\\n\xa0 storageSize: 2Gi\xa0\\n\\n\xa0 ui:\xa0\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 enabled: false\xa0\\n\\n\xa0 useExistingSecret: true\xa0\\n```\\n\\nIf you want, you can, for example, change the\xa0s3gw.storageClass.name\xa0used by s3gw to create its PVC to persist the data.\xa0Leaving this field empty makes the s3gw use the default storage class in the cluster.\xa0Furthermore, you can set the\xa0s3gw.storageSize\xa0value to the appropriate size based on your need.\\n\\nEmbedding s3gw inside Epinio has been beneficial for both projects because it significantly evolved the respective ability to integrate with other technologies.\\n\\nThanks to this, s3gw has made huge progress in areas such as TLS management and chart consistency.\\n\\ns3gw was born in 2022 and that year we defined the project\'s foundations. As for 2023, the team has ambitious plans that will bring the project to a brand-new level. We are already confident the tool is good enough to start integrating with vibrant projects like Epinio and are planning to make s3gw even simpler to integrate in the future.\\n\\nStay tuned!\\n\\n## Call to action\\n\\nWe would love to hear from you about what you\'d like to see on our roadmap.

Some of it, especially screenshots, may contain\\n`aquarist-labs` references. Keep that in mind when following tutorials.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nBefore you begin, if you have not heard yet of the\xa0[s3gw](https://s3gw.tech/)\xa0project, read this article first. The s3gw is a lightweight S3 service for Kubernetes users running on top of a Longhorn PV (and it comes with a nice user interface).\\n\\nFor the purpose of this article, there is assumed knowledge of\xa0[K3s](http://k3s.io/),\xa0[Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/)\xa0and\xa0[Longhorn](http://longhorn.io/).\xa0 However, if you need more information, you will find plenty of useful information in this blog.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nYou will need to have created a Droplet in Digital Ocean. For this specific tutorial, you will need the following:\xa0\\n\\n- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64\\n- CPU Options: Regular Intel with SSD + 8 GB / 4 CPUs\xa0\xa0\\n- Add block storage: Leave as it is\\n- Datacenter region: Choose the datacenter region closer to you\\n- VPC Network: Leave as it is\\n- Authentication: via SSH, click the \\"new SSH Key\\", follow the instructions given (identify your ssh key properly) and after it is added, select it with the appropriate checkbox.\\n- Additional Options: Leave as it is\\n- Finalize and create: identify your droplet with a hostname (ex: `<your name>-local-rancher`).\\n- Hit Create Droplet\\n\\nAnd there you go! You have a system ready to hack on!\\n\\n## Prepare your system\xa0\\n\\nNow we need to set up your droplet. Install Helm:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ ssh root@IP-ADDRESS\\n$ apt-get install open-iscsi\\n$ snap install --classic helm\\n```\\n\\n1\\\\. Install K3s\\n\\nNow, set up K3s:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ curl -sfL [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io/) | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=\\"v1.24.7+k3s1\\" sh -s - server --cluster-init\xa0\\n$ export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml\xa0\xa0\\n```\\n\\n2\\\\. Define a Kubernetes namespace\\n\\nNow, we need to define a Kubernetes namespace where the resources created by the chart should be installed:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl create namespace cattle-system\xa0\\n```\\n\\n3\\\\. Set up certificate management\\n\\nNext, set up cert-manager:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl apply -f <https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml>\xa0\\n\\n$ helm repo add jetstack [https://charts.jetstack.io](https://charts.jetstack.io/)\\n$ helm repo update\\n$ helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager\\\\\\n\xa0 --namespace cert-manager\\\\\\n\xa0 --create-namespace\\\\\\n\xa0 --version v1.7.1\xa0\\n```\\n\\n4\\\\. Install Rancher server\\n\\nOnce you are done installing K3s, install Rancher through the helm chart:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ helm repo add rancher-latest <https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest>\xa0\\n\\n$ helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher\\\\\\n\xa0 --namespace cattle-system\\\\\\n\xa0 --set hostname= IP-ADDRESS[.sslip.io](http://164.92.168.210.sslip.io/)\\\\\\n\xa0 --set replicas=1\\\\\\n\xa0 --set bootstrapPassword=PASSWORD\xa0\\n```\\n\\nWe are using sslip.io as the DNS service. The installation will take some time. Then you will be ready to access Rancher:\\n\\n![Rancher login page](/blog-assets/2023-01-25/article-rancher-1-1024x740.png)\\n\\n5\\\\. Retrieve the password\\n\\nRetrieve your password by running the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl get secret --namespace cattle-system bootstrap-secret -o go-template=\'{{ .data.bootstrapPassword|base64decode}}{{ \\"\\\\n\\" }}\'\\n```\\n\\n## Install s3gw using the Rancher UI\\n\\nThe s3gw can be found in the Rancher UI as a partner chart:\\n\\nTo access, go to \\"Apps\\" and then \\"Charts\\". Choose the partner charts drop-down and click on the s3gw partner chart:\xa0\\n\\n![Rancher partner charts](/blog-assets/2023-01-25/s3gw-partner-chart-1-1024x740.png)\\n\\nClick\xa0 \\"Install\\" and tick the \\"Customize Helm options before install\\":\\n\\n![s3gw-install](/blog-assets/2023-01-25/s3gw-install-1024x740.png)\\n\\nHere are the remaining three steps:\\n\\n1. Set App Metadata: Select the project to install s3gw into.\\n2. Values: Here, you can set up access and secret keys, storage, etc. The chart sets up a Longhorn volume by default.\xa0 Update are the hostnames for the S3 service and the UI:\\n\\n![s3gw installation values](/blog-assets/2023-01-25/s3gw-install-values-1024x779.png)\\n\\n3\\\\. Finally, there are other options you can also set up additional deployment options:\\n\\n![Helm options](/blog-assets/2023-01-25/s3gw-helm-opts-1024x653.png)\\n\\nAnd that\'s it! You can now access the s3gw UI in https://s3gw-ui.your.ip.here.sslip.io) :\\n\\n![s3gw login](/blog-assets/2023-01-25/s3gw-login-1024x747.png)\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f\xa0\\"Network failure\\" issue.\\n\\nWhen you try to log into the UI for the first time, you will find a \\"Network Failure\\" error. This is a\xa0[known issue](https://github.com/s3gw-tech/s3gw/issues/275).\\n\\nTo work around this issue, access the S3 service URL first ([https://s3gw.your.ip.here.sslip.io](https://s3gw.your.ip.here.sslip.io/)). You will then be able to log into the UI:\\n\\n![s3gw-file-explorer](/blog-assets/2023-01-25/s3gw-file-explorer-1024x747.png)\\n\\n\\n## Call to action\\n\\nWe would love to hear from you about what you\'d like to see on our roadmap.

However, the s3gw can be deployed in a myriad of scenarios, provided some form of storage is attached.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\ns3gw is based on Ceph\'s RADOSGW (RGW) but runs as a stand--alone service without the RADOS cluster and relies on a storage backend still under heavy development by the storage team at SUSE. The s3gw team is also developing a web-based UI for management and an object explorer.\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nThis content was adapted from the original `aquarist-labs` organization to the\\nnew `s3gw-tech` organization. Some of it, especially screenshots, may contain\\n`aquarist-labs` references. Keep that in mind when following tutorials.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## The s3gw service\\n\\nDistributed as a small container, the s3gw service runs RGW and exposes an S3-compatible API. Instead of requiring a full Ceph cluster deployment, we leverage RGW\'s standalone capabilities and keep data on a local storage volume. Although the focus is on running within a Kubernetes environment with on-premise storage provided to the container, s3gw can consume any storage type with a filesystem on it. This can be PVC in Kubernetes or a local directory on a development machine.\\n\\nAs the container consumes the storage volume, the object data is kept in a hash tree of directories and the metadata is kept in an SQLite database. This allows us to leverage the ACID properties of SQLite to ensure the state is committed atomically while keeping large blobs of data on the filesystem and away from SQLite\'s path.\xa0\\n\\nIn the future,\xa0we will release a blog post describing the s3gw service\'s data store in more depth.\\n\\nHowever, it should be noted that we don\'t support all RGW\'s S3 APIs. Some components are still under development and other features not yet included that are required for proper operation.\xa0\\n\\nFor example, while deleting objects and buckets is currently supported, we don\'t support lifecycle management. Lifecycle policies and IAM are some of the things that we will be working on shortly.\xa0\\n\\n## The s3gw web UI\\n\\nAlso distributed as a small container, the s3gw web UI provides an intuitive way of interacting with the s3gw service. This includes user and bucket management, as well as an object explorer.\xa0\\n\\nWe have a few screenshots of the current UI version below, but please keep in mind that we are still actively developing it and it is not feature-complete.\\n\\n![s3gw login page screenshot](/blog-assets/2022-11-21/s3gw-login-1-1024x747.png)\\n![s3gw dashboard screenshot](/blog-assets/2022-11-21/s3gw-dashboard-1-1024x747.png)\\n![s3gw bucket creation](/blog-assets/2022-11-21/Screenshot-2022-11-21-at-15.49.46-1024x751.png)\\n![s3gw bucket list dashboard screeenshot](/blog-assets/2022-11-21/s3gw-list-buckets-1024x747.png)\\n![s3gw file explorer](/blog-assets/2022-11-21/s3gw-file-explorer-1-1024x747.png)\\n\\n## \xa0Installing\\n\\nYou may find our Helm chart helpful if you have a Kubernetes cluster, whichever flavor that might be.

S3 is a vast protocol that covers key concepts such as\xa0*buckets*,\xa0*objects*,\xa0*keys*,\xa0*versioning*,\xa0*ACLs*\xa0and\xa0*regions*.\\n\\nTo continue with this article, you need to know that the S3 API can be invoked with REST calls and that you can just store your objects inside holders called buckets. For more information, there are other resources available online.\\n\\n## \xa0K3s and Rancher\\n\\nThis article explores the use of\xa0[K3s](https://k3s.io/)\xa0and\xa0[Rancher](https://rancher.com/)\xa0as foundations for experiments with an S3 gateway.\\n\\n![K3S logo](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/k3s-icon-color-1-300x245.png)\\n\\nK3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that runs smoothly on Edge low resource devices. Rancher is a graphical user manager that simplifies the underlying complexity of a Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\n![Rancher logo](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/rancher-logo-cow-black.png)\\n\\nWith Rancher, you can manage a cluster in a user-friendly fashion, regardless of the Kubernetes version being used.\\n\\n## Longhorn\\n\\n![Longhorn logo](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/longhorn.png)\\n\\nA Kubernetes cluster and manager alone are not sufficient when dealing with cloud storage. You could use the primitive resources offered by a standard Kubernetes cluster such as the basic persistent volume types,\xa0but we recommend installing a component that takes care of providing your pods with some advanced storage resource.\\n\\nIt is desirable to have a system that can take care of your data securely and in a redundant fasion and expose volumes with the standard Kubernetes interfaces.\xa0[Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/)\xa0is the right system for this kind of need. Built from scratch to work natively with Kubernetes, Longhorn allows pods to obtain highly available persistent volumes. The portion of storage managed by Longhorn is replicated so that a\xa0hardware failure does not compromise user\'s data.\\n\\n## S3 Gateway\\n\\n![S3GW logo](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/logo-s3gw-300x256.png)\\n\\nHaving Longhorn deployed on your cluster allows the\xa0persistent volumes to be consumed by internal applications deployed on Kubernetes. If you want to give access to the data to external clients, you need an S3 gateway.\\n\\nExternal clients can store and read data to and from the cluster using the S3 API. For this role, we are going to employ\xa0[s3gw.](https://aquarist-labs.io/s3gw/)\\n\\ns3gw is being developed on the foundations of\xa0[Ceph](https://ceph.com/en/)\xa0S3 gateway: radosgw. Even if s3gw is still in its infancy and still in an early stage of development, it can already be used to test and play with S3 functionalities.\\n\\n## Let\'s start cooking ingredients\\n\\nNow that you have identified all the pieces, you are ready to start building your environment.\\\\\\nFor this tutorial, we are installing K3s on an OpenSUSE Linux OS. For the sake of simplicity, because Kubernetes needs to have certain networking resources available, it can be worth completely disabling the system firewall.\\n\\nIf you prefer to keep your firewall on, have a look\xa0[here](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/installation-requirements/#networking).\\n\\n### Stop Firewall\\n\\nFrom a shell prompt, run the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl stop firewalld.service\\n```\\n\\n### Install K3s\\n\\nFrom a shell prompt, run the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ curl -sfL <https://get.k3s.io> | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.23.9+k3s1 sh -\\n```\\n\\nAfter installation has terminated, you can check that the cluster is running with:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo kubectl get nodes\\n```\\n\\nIf everything is ok, you should see something similar:\\n\\n```bash\\nNAME STATUS ROLES                AGE   VERSION\\nsuse Ready  control-plane,master 56s   v1.23.8+k3s1\\n```\\n\\nIf you prefer using K3s with your regular user and not as root, you can run:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config && chown $USER ~/.kube/config && chmod 600 ~/.kube/config && export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config\\n```\\n\\nAfter this, you will be able to operate on K3s with your user.\\n\\n### Install Helm\\n\\n![Helm logo](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/helm-260x300.png)\\n\\nWe are going to install Rancher using an\xa0[Helm](https://helm.sh/)\xa0chart, so you must first install Helm on the system:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ sudo zypper install helm\\n```\\n\\n### Deploy Rancher\\n\\nLet\'s begin to install Rancher adding the its latest repo to Helm:\\n\\n```bash\\n$\xa0helm repo add rancher-latest <https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest>\\n```\\n\\nAfter this, you must define a new Kubernetes namespace where Rancher will install:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl create namespace cattle-system\\n```\\n\\nAs the official\xa0[documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/#install-the-rancher-helm-chart)\xa0dictates, this must be named\xa0*cattle-system.*\\n\\nBecause Rancher management server is designed to be secure by default and requires SSL/TLS configuration you must deploy some additional resource:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl apply -f <https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml>\\n\\n$ helm repo add jetstack <https://charts.jetstack.io>\\n\\n$ helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager\\\\\\n --namespace cert-manager\\\\\\n --create-namespace\\\\\\n --version v1.7.1\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s check that the cert-manager has successfully deployed and the related pods are running:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\nNAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\ncert-manager-5c6866597-zw7kh               1/1     Running   0          2m\\ncert-manager-cainjector-577f6d9fd7-tr77l   1/1     Running   0          2m\\ncert-manager-webhook-787858fcdb-nlzsq      1/1     Running   0          2m\\n```\\n\\nNow, you are required to define an hostname in /etc/hosts pointing to the ip address of one of the host\'s physical interfaces, for example:\\n\\n10.0.0.2 rancher.local\\n\\nAfter this, you can finally launch the Rancher installation command:\\n\\n```bash\\nhelm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher\\\\\\n --namespace cattle-system\\\\\\n --set hostname=rancher.local\\\\\\n --set bootstrapPassword=admin\\n```\\n\\nWhen Rancher\'s pods have booted up,\xa0 with your browser you can navigate to:\xa0[https://rancher.local](https://rancher.local) and complete the initial setup:\\n\\n![Screenshot 1](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/rancher1-1024x943.png)\\n\\nOnce you have completed the step, and saved the password, you can start exploring your local cluster with the graphical manager:\\n\\n![Screenshot 2](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/rancher.local_-1024x614.png)\\n\\nDepending on what you have deployed on the cluster, you could see more or less resource consumption.\\n\\n### Deploy Longhorn\\n\\nYou can now deploy Longhorn using the Charts chooser under the Apps section on the left of the Rancher\'s dashboard:\\n\\n![Another Screenshot](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/rancher3-1024x727.png)\\n\\nThe installation is pretty straightforward and you don\'t need to change any\\ndefault value of the chart.\\n\\nIn the end, if everything has gone well, you should see the Rancher\'s console showing:\\n\\n![Screenshot 3](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/ranch-longh-install-1024x596.png)\\n\\nAfter Longhorn has been installed, you can simply click on the Longhorn entry on the left Rancher\'s menu to be redirected to the Longhorn\'s dashboard:\\n\\n![Another Screenshot 2](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/long-dash-1024x651.png)\\n\\nA freshly installation of Longhorn shows that still no application is using a persistent volume.\\n\\n### Deploy s3gw\\n\\nYou are now ready to add the last ingredient to your system: s3gw, the S3\\ngateway.\\n\\nRancher does not bundle with the\xa0[Helm repository of s3gw](https://github.com/s3gw-tech/s3gw-charts)\xa0set\xa0by default, so you must add it from the dashboard:\\n\\n![Screenshot 4](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/s3gw-repo-add-1024x608.png)\\n\\nYou can choose an unique name: for example: s3gw.\\n\\nFor the Target field you have to choose Git repository and the repository URL:\\n\\n[https://github.com/s3gw-tech/s3gw-charts](https://github.com/s3gw-tech/s3gw-charts)\\n\\nIn the Git Branch field put the latest available release:\\n\\nv0.2.0\\n\\nYou can now click on Create button.\\\\\\nOn Apps section, you can now find the s3gw chart:\\n\\n![Screenshot 5](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/s3gw-chart-1024x630.png)\\n\\nSo let\'s proceed with installation; you can choose a namespace and a name for s3gw:\\n\\n![Screenshot 6](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/s3gw-ns1-1024x657.png)\\n\\nYou don\'t need to customize the chart, so you can leave the bottom checkbox\\nunchecked.\\n\\nOnce the installation completed, if everything has gone well, you should see the Rancher\'s console showing:\\n\\n![Screenshot 7](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/s3gw-installed-1024x774.png)\\n\\nOn Longhorn dashboard, you can verify that the application is using a Longhorn persistent volume:\\n\\n![Screenshot 8](/blog-assets/2022-07-28/lh-s3gw-1024x480.png)\\n\\n### Test the S3 gateway\\n\\nBy default the s3gw chart configures an ingress resource pointing to the S3\\ngateway with the FQDN: s3gw.local .\\n\\nThus, you must define\xa0s3gw.local in /etc/hosts pointing to the ip address of one of the host\'s physical interfaces, for example:\\n\\n10.0.0.2 s3gw.local\\n\\nFor testing the S3 gateway you can rely\\non\xa0[s3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd)\xa0that is a popular command line S3\\nclient.\\n\\nYou can install it choosing a method\\nlisted\xa0[here](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/blob/master/INSTALL.md).\\n\\nOnce you have installed it, you can take the s3cmd configuration file\\nfrom\xa0[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3gw-tech/s3gw/main/tools/env/s3cmd.cfg)\xa0and\\nuse that as it is against s3gw.\\n\\nAll you need to to is to create a directory, put s3cmd.cfg inside that and finally invoke s3cmd.\\n\\n#### Create a bucket\\n\\n```bash\\n$\xa0s3cmd -c s3cmd.cfg mb s3://foo\\n```\\n\\n#### Put some objects in the bucket\\n\\nLet\'s create a 1 MB file filled with random data and put it in the\xa0 bucket:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ dd if=/dev/random bs=1k count=1k of=obj.1mb.bin\\n$ s3cmd -c s3cmd.cfg put obj.1mb.bin s3://foo\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s create a 10 MB file filled with random data and put it in the bucket:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ dd if=/dev/random bs=1k count=10k of=obj.10mb.bin\\n$ s3cmd -c s3cmd.cfg put obj.10mb.bin s3://foo\\n```\\n\\n#### List objects contained in a bucket\\n\\n```bash\\n$ s3cmd -c s3cmd.cfg ls s3://foo\\n2022-07-26 15:03 10485760  s3://foo/obj.10mb.bin\\n2022-07-26 15:01 1048576   s3://foo/obj.1mb.bin\\n```\\n\\n#### Delete an object\\n\\n```bash\\n$ s3cmd -c s3cmd.cfg rm s3://foo/obj.10mb.bin\\n```\\n\\n### In summary\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you\'ve seen how to set up a K3s cluster, manage it with Rancher, install Longhorn and finally enrich the system with a S3 gateway. K3s, Rancher and Longhorn are powerful tools to set up an environment providing resilient and performing storage capabilities. If you need to expose the storage to external clients, you can choose to install s3gw with a near zero effort.\\n\\n## Call to action\\n\\nWe would love to hear from you about what you\'d like to see on our roadmap.

This new project provides the required infrastructure to build a container able to run on a Kubernetes cluster with S3-compatible endpoints to applications.\\n\\nThis is the first publicly available iteration of the s3gw project. We expect (and welcome!) bugs and we know our performance is not optimal (yet!). This release is meant for testing and feedback gathering and it is not recommended for production use.
